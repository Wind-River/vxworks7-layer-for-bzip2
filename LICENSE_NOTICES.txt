DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES: WIND RIVER AND ITS LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL 
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE 
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO OPEN SOURCE 
SOFTWARE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY WIND RIVER, ITS 
DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES SHALL IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS 
WARRANTY. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of 
implied warranties or how long an implied warranty may last, so the above 
limitations may not apply to Customer. This warranty gives Customer specific 
legal rights and Customer may have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to 
jurisdiction.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: WIND RIVER AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL 
NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES 
OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, PROCUREMENT OF 
SUBSTITUTE GOODS, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR THE LIKE) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF 
ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT PRODUCT 
LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED 
TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF WIND RIVER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL WIND RIVER'S AGGREGATE 
CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO OPEN SOURCE 
SOFTWARE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). Some jurisdictions do not allow 
the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages so this 
limitation and exclusion may not apply to Customer.

THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE 
BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN WIND RIVER AND CUSTOMER. WIND RIVER WOULD NOT BE 
ABLE TO PROVIDE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.
